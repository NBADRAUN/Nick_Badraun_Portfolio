# Nick_Badraun_Portfolio

## Description

This project Assignment is focused on building and deploying a full stack project portfolio page for Nick Badraun.  

## User Story Provided 

<Br>AS AN employer
<Br>I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
<Br>SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria 
<Br>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
<Br>Issue 1: 
<Br>WHEN I load their portfolio, THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
<Br>Issue 2:
<Br>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation, THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
<Br>Issue 3:
<Br>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work, THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
<Br>Issue 4: 
<Br>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application, THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
<Br>Issue 5: 
<Br>WHEN I click on the images of the applications, THEN I am taken to that deployed application
<Br>Issue 6: 
<Br>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
